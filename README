Goal:

This program can play a human 1 vs 1 in a game of Texas Holdem. At a high level the program has two main features:

1.	Calculate the probability of poker hands based on different stages of games play, and 		from this information deduce an optimum betting strategy. 

2. 	The ability to Bluff based on a number of previously determined Bluff Types. 

From theses ‘base’ features several interesting features can follow, i.e. Machine Learning integration for exotic bluff types, ELO rating for different betting strategies, etc. 

Progression of Development (V1.0)

We need some underlying ADTs to build the poker environment.
class Deck
class Table
class Player 

In addition to these base ADTs we may need to build more.
We also need to build efficient operations and test them, so that when we move to gameplay our foundation is solid. 

2.  We need some kind of interface to test gameplay element.
